RackPeek is a webui & CLI tool for documenting and managing home lab and small-scale IT infrastructure.

It helps you track hardware, services, networks, and their relationships in a clear, scriptable, and reusable way without enterprise bloat or proprietary lock-in or drowning in unnecessary metadata or process.

### The roadmap for the next wave of features is actively being discussed, please make your voice heard!

## Running RackPeek with Docker
```text
# Named volume
docker volume create rackpeek-config
docker run -d \
  --name rackpeek \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v rackpeek-config:/app/config \
  aptacode/rackpeek:latest

# Bind mount
mkdir -p config
sudo chown 1654:1654 config
docker run -d \
  --name rackpeek \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v $(pwd)/config:/app/config:Z \
  aptacode/rackpeek:latest

# RackPeek runs as UID/GID 1654:1654 inside the container, so a bind-mounted
# host directory must be writable by that user. The :Z suffix is needed on
# SELinux-enabled systems such as Fedora, RHEL, and CentOS; it can be omitted
# on systems without SELinux.

# To verify the container user:
docker exec rackpeek id

# Note - RackPeek stores its state in YAML
config/
└── config.yaml
```
Or Docker compose
```yaml
version: "3.9"

services:
  rackpeek:
    image: aptacode/rackpeek:latest
    container_name: rackpeek
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - rackpeek-config:/app/config
    restart: unless-stopped
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-fsS", "http://localhost:8080/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 5s
      start_period: 15s
      retries: 3

volumes:
  rackpeek-config:

## Questionnaire

We’re gathering feedback from homelabbers to validate direction and prioritize features.  
Answer whichever questions stand out to you, your input directly shapes the project.

## Core Values

**Simplicity**  
RackPeek focuses on clarity and usefulness. Its scope is intentionally kept narrow to avoid unnecessary abstraction and feature creep.

**Ease of Deployment**  
The tool exists to reduce operational complexity. Installation, upgrades, and day-to-day usage should be straightforward and low-friction.

**Openness**  
RackPeek uses open, non-proprietary data formats. You fully own your data and should be free to easily inspect, migrate, or reuse it however you choose.

**Community**  
Contributors of all experience levels are welcome. Knowledge sharing, mentorship, and collaboration are core to the project’s culture.

**Privacy & Security**  
No telemetry, no ads, no tracking, and no artificial restrictions. What runs on your infrastructure stays on your infrastructure.

**Dogfooding**  
RackPeek is built to solve real problems we actively have. If a feature isn’t useful in practice, it doesn’t belong.

**Opinionated**  
The project is optimized for home labs and self-hosted environments, not enterprise CMDBs or corporate documentation workflows.
